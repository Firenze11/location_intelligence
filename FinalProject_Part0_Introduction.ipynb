    "Understanding the mind of the customers is essential for a successful business. In fact, lots of IT companies have launched **Location recommendation services** based on a person's past behavioral patterns to predict where he/she could be next and what he/she may like. For example, Yelp Nearby and Google Now can both provide personalized recommendations.\n",

    "There are quite some work on tracking and prediciting location based on information collected through smartphone. For example, [Nokia's Mobile Data Challenge](http://www.idiap.ch/~gatica/publications/LaurilaGaticaEtal-mdc12.pdf). In [this paper by Do & Gatica-Perez](http://www.idiap.ch/~gatica/publications/DoGatica-pmc13.pdf) used the smartphone data (where, when and what apps people used in their smartphone)  behavioral patterns and study how generic behavior models can improve the predictive performance of personalized models. However, the behavioral pattern during vacation might differ a lot from daily life. For example, instead of going to the same places over and over again, tourists might be a \"exploration\" mode to visit different places. Thus our project might provide new insights in understanding behavioral patterns."
